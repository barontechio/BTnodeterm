/**
 * Runs a project's `setup`/`archive` script behind the trust gate.
 *
 * The load-bearing invariants:
 *  - Only a SHARED-sourced script is gated. A value the user typed into this machine's own local
 *    overlay is their own instruction and runs promptless; a value that arrived through git (or
 *    from a remote host) is hostile input until a human approves it at that location.
 *  - What is approved is the FAMILY, not the one script: the trust content covers setupScript AND
 *    archiveScript (`projectTrustContent('setup', …)`), hashed from the SHARED document alone —
 *    never the merged/effective one, or a local override could launder a shared change past the
 *    hash.
 *  - Trust is keyed by LOCATION (`localTrustKey`/`sshTrustKey`), never by project id: ids come out
 *    of an attacker-controlled `project.json` (hostile-project-json).
 *  - The answer is a trichotomy — approve / skip / nobody-answered. Only `approve` records and
 *    runs; an expired prompt is never a retroactive yes.
 *  - Prompts are serialized app-wide: one dialog at a time, so a workspace opening five projects
 *    cannot stack five modals over each other.
 *  - The prompt goes to the HOST's own UI (`sendConsent`), never to the broadcast fan-out: the
 *    question — and the script bytes it renders — belongs to the human at this machine.
 *
 * Spawning itself is injected (`runLocal`/`runSsh`) — this file knows nothing about child_process
 * or ssh, which is also what makes the gate testable without a shell.
 *
 * `ensureFamilyTrusted` is the same gate aimed at the families this service never RUNS — the launch
 * settings (`agents`) and the terminal program (`shell`) a caller elsewhere is about to consume. It
 * reuses every invariant above (one queue, one dialog, the trichotomy, location keying, host-only
 * delivery) through the same `queuePrompt` core, and adds one of its own: an approval broadcasts
 * `IPC.projectTrustChanged` so a renderer holding a stale "not trusted" verdict re-reads it.
