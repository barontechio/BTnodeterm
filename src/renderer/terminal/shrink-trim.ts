import type { Terminal } from '@xterm/xterm'

/**
 * Trims every buffer line to the terminal's width after a narrowing resize, which xterm only does
 * for a buffer that reflows.
 *
 * `Buffer.resize` cuts the cells past the new right edge inside its `_isReflowEnabled` branch, and
 * reflow needs scrollback: the ALTERNATE buffer never has any, so its lines keep their old length
 * (still true on xterm.js master). Nothing draws those cells, but two things read them:
 *
 * 1. **The search addon.** It reads each line to its stored length, finds text that is no longer on
 *    screen, and for a hit past the edge computes a decoration width of `cols - col` — negative.
 *    `registerDecoration` throws "This API only accepts positive integers", and since the find bar
 *    runs `findNext` inside a React effect, the node's error boundary replaced the whole node with
 *    an error card. Every Claude Code node is on the alternate screen, so narrowing one node and
 *    then searching in it was enough. Measured with xterm 5.5.0 + addon-search 0.16.0.
 * 2. **A later widening.** `BufferLine.resize` grows a line over its old cells, so widening back
 *    brought the cut-off text back on screen until the app repainted the row.
 *
 * Trimming is what xterm already does to a reflowing buffer, and a trimmed cell is one nothing
 * displays, so for the visible screen this changes nothing.
 *
 * Guarded and fail-open in the same style as `patchViewportScrollSync`: if a private field is
 * missing on a future xterm version, the patch leaves stock behavior intact.
