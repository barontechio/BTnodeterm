// The replies of `resize` and `place` (issue #1288), kept pure so the sentences an agent acts on are
// tested where Canvas.tsx — a component with no unit seam — cannot be.
//
// The rule both follow: say what was APPLIED, not what was asked. A clamped size, a node that was
// restored from maximized first, a collapsed node whose height waits for its expand, a framed child
// that rode along with its frame — each is a difference between the request and the canvas, and an
// agent that cannot see the difference builds its next call on the wrong numbers.
